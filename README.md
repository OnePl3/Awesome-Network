## Methods
WiFi CSI sensing methods have enabled many applications, which can be divided into three categories:
* **Learning-based methods** learn the mapping functions from CSI data to the corresponding labels by [machine learning]() and deep learning.
* **Modeling-based methods** are based on physical theories like the [Fresnel Zone model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8067692), or statistical models like the [Rician fading model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385792).
* **Hybrid methods** derive the strengths from learning-based and modeling-based methods.
